Code of Conduct:

As members of this group project, we are committed to creating a safe and inclusive environment where everyone is respected and valued. We will work collaboratively towards our common goals, and we will always strive to be kind, supportive, and professional in our interactions.

To ensure that everyone can participate fully and equally, we have established the following guidelines:

1. Respectful and professional communication: All group members must communicate respectfully and professionally at all times. This includes being mindful of language, tone, and cultural differences, and avoiding personal attacks or offensive behavior.

2. Timely completion of work: All members must complete the work they have been delegated by the required deadline. If a member is unable to meet a deadline, they must communicate with the other group members as soon as possible to discuss possible solutions.

3. Attendance and participation: All group members must attend the weekly lab sessions and participate in any scheduled meetings or catch-ups. If a member is unable to attend a meeting, they must give a minimum of 24 hours' notice to the other group members.

4. Open communication: All group members must ensure that they provide reasonable quick replies to any communications (24 hours) and if they are unable to communicate for a period of time they inform the other members. This ensures that everyone is informed and can plan accordingly.

5. Failure to meet expectations: If a group member is not fulfilling their responsibilities or meeting expectations, they will be notified by the other members in a respectful and constructive manner. If the behavior continues, the group will consult with the tutor to develop a plan of action.

6. All group members must be open and transparent in their communication and actively seek to resolve conflicts in a constructive and respectful manner.

7. All group members must actively seek feedback from other group members, and be open and receptive to feedback and constructive criticism.

8. All group members must adhere to ethical principles and academic standards, including academic integrity and the responsible use of resources.

9. All group members must respect the privacy and confidentiality of other group members, and must not share any confidential or personal information without prior consent.

10. All group members must work together to ensure that the project is completed successfully, and must actively contribute to the success of the project.

11. All group members must maintain a positive attitude and work collaboratively, treating all other group members with respect, courtesy, and professionalism.

Code of conduct agreement: All group members must read, agree, and sign this code of conduct. By signing this agreement, we commit to upholding these guidelines and working together in a professional and respectful manner.

We believe that by following these guidelines, we can create a positive and productive environment where everyone feels valued and supported. If you have any questions or concerns.
