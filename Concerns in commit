i have some major concerns with the commits in this github regarding documents that i have SOLELY worked on myself i have all of the original documents to prove it and i will re submit everything i have worked on solely for myself and not for the groups benefit 
If I see any more commits on any documents that I have solely worked on myself with no help I will have issues. so Partho and Illias do not comment or try and commit any more of my work that i worked on myself with none of your help i already have screenshots and proof of lack of contribution from when i submitted compared to the changes added which has been one word changes or comments just for you to get contributions
